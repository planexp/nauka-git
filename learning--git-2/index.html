        <h1>Boy Harsher - A Realness</h1>
        <p>Who am I?
            Who am I?

            Clutching the wheel with both hands
            I am learning how to drive

            My heart is racing
            Rising
            It's how we survive

            There's a realness to the hands
            That pull you away
            There's a realness to the voice
            That asks you to stay

            You're the door that keeps closing
            Keeps closing on me

            I am the heart
            Always broken
            Broken by that sound

            It is not enough
            It is not enough

            It's never enough

            It is not enough
            It is not enough
            It's never enough

            Please don't go

            So let's drive

            So let's drive

            Watching the wind with both eyes
            I am moving away

            Clutching the wheel with both hands
            I'm running away

            Please don't go
            You'll never stay</p>
